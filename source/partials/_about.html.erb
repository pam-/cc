<h1>about COLOR CODED</h1>

<p>Color Coded is an initiative created to uplift people of color in the tech industry and in their communities. Through a series of thoughtfully designed events, Color Coded's goals are to contribute to the creation of safe spaces for underrepresented communities and help people of color gain the tools, skills, and network they need to get that promotion, run a business, or simply feel the power of knowledge.</p>
<p> Each event will take place in the form of a collaborative and/or pedagogical gathering. Topics and themes will vary and go from code, to entrepreneurship, to maintaining mental and physical wellness. </p>

<p> The Color Coded initiative is sponsored by <a href="http://voxmedia.com">Vox Media Inc</a>. It was started by <a href="http://twitter.com/pam_yam">Pam Assogba</a>, a Full Stack Engineer at Vox.
