      We invite all those who participate in Color Coded to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.</p>

      <h2>2.‎ ‏OPEN [SOURCE/CULTURE/TECH] CITIZENSHIP</h2>
      <p>A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.</p>
      <p>Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.</p>
      <p>If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.</p>

      <h2>3.‎ ‏EXPECTED BEHAVIOR</h2>

      <p>Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.</p>
      <p>Attempt collaboration before conflict.</p>
      <p>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.</p>
      <p>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</p>

      <h2>4.‎ ‏UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR</h2>
      <p>Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.</p>
      <p>Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

      <h2>5.‎ CONSEQUENCES OF UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR</h2>
      <p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.
      Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.</p>
      <p>If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.</p>

      <h2>6.‎ ‏IF YOU WITNESS OR ARE SUBJECT TO UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR</h2>
      <p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. Reach Color Coded organizers at pixelpunch [at] voxmedia.com.</p>
      <p>Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.</p>

      <p>We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues—online and in- person—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.</p>
